# Matlab-Final-Code

This repository contain codes of the "Quantitative Finance Analysis" course's final exam questions and codes.

There are 4 questions in the final exam. We are given a total time of 3 hours. I got 94 out of 100 in the final exam. (For some grading mistake, it shows 91 in the comment, but it actually should be 94.) The comments start with #stu are the comments by my professor.
